## Project Description

This project aims to simulate the behavior of 100 interconnected gears. It provides a visual representation of the gear movements and their interactions, which can be used for educational purposes or mechanical design analysis.

## Features

- Simulate the interaction of 100 gears
- Visualize gear movements
- Analyze gear behavior and interactions
- Customizable gear parameters

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kodesam/simulate-100-gears.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd simulate-100-gears
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the gear simulation, use the following command:

```sh
python main.py
```
